<h1>Real estate web application made with Django</h1>

<p>BTRE project is a project made during Brad Traversy's online course. 
  We created a fully functional site for an imaginary company, BT Real Estate.
  The focus was on the logic and the functionality, therefore the design templates 
  were premade and relied on Bootstrap.</p>

<p>Feautures of the page:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Dinamically changing seller of the month</li>
  <li>Possibility to search properties by features</li>
  <li>Inquiry about listing via contact form (not neccesary to log in!)</li>
  <li>The users can view their inquiries under 
   their personal dashboard (if they're registered)</li>
  <li>PostgreSQL database which can 
   be edited by realtors and admins</li>  
  <li>Staff and User login</li>
  <li>Admin area customized according to the company's needs</li>
</ul>
